This has moved to lasagne
=========================
The SpatialTransformerLayer has been moved to Lasagne. The Lasagne version is
identical except for very minor interface changes.

See <http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/layers/special.html#lasagne.layers.TransformerLayer>.
You need to install lasagne from github to get the spatial transformer layer.

I created an example usage here <https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/pull/7>.
It's currently a pull request.

You can import ``TransformerLayer`` from transformerlayer.py and use it as any
other lasagne layer.
